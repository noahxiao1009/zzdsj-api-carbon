# ================================================================
# RAG Data Source Master Index File
# ================================================================
#
# This file defines which data sources the RAG system will load at startup,
# and which data source is the default target for writing new data (e.g., user-uploaded documents).

# Each entry in the `active_sources` list must have a corresponding .yaml
# configuration file with the same name in the `rag_configs/` directory.
active_sources:
  # - arxiv_search_source      # Corresponds to arxiv_search_source.yaml, a read-only external ArXiv abstract database
  - internal_project_docs    # Corresponds to internal_project_docs.yaml, a writable internal database for indexing project files

# `default_writable_source` specifies which data source data should be written to
# when an Agent calls the rag_add tool. This value must be one of the `active_sources`,
# and its corresponding YAML file must have `database_writable` set to true.
default_writable_source: "internal_project_docs"
